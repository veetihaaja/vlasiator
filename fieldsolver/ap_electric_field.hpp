 *
 * AP (CSL-RME) field solver -- Liu, Cai, Cao, Lapenta (2025), J. Comput.
 * Phys. 528, 113840. Implements Eqs. (23), (35)-(41), (45): the
 * reformulated-Maxwell electric field solve (Eq. 38) replacing the old
 * explicit RK2/Ohm's-law propagateFields, keeping Faraday's law (Eq. 23) and
 * adding an optional Gauss's-law correction (Eq. 45) and optional low-pass
 * filtering.
 *
 * E, B, rho_s, J_s, mu and J-hat are all collocated in the fieldsolver. They
 * live at the centres of the Vlasov cells, exactly where f_s and its moments
 * are stored. The solver therefore keeps its own persistent "node-centred"
 * copy of E^k and B^k and never has to interpolate between the field solve and
 * the particle push.
 *
 * To couple with the rest of vlasiator he node-centred B^{k+theta} and
 * E^{k+theta} fields are written to the `vol` fields (PERB?VOL, E?VOL). For
 * output (that expects quantities on a Yee lattice) we interpolate
 * node-centered fields to produce face center B fields (perb at time level k+1
 * and perbdt2) and edge centered E fields (e at time k+1 and edt2). B_c sits
 * on the face between cell i-1 and i along c; E_c sits on the edge shared by
 * the 4 cells at offsets {0,-1} along the two axes other than c. For
 * initialization and restart we have to do to averaging to get node-centered
 * state from perb and e from the restart files.
 *
 * The solver is using second-order centered differences. The same centred curl
 * is used for Faraday (Eq. 23) and Ampere (curl B^k in Eq. 38), and curl-curl
 * is its composition, so that the discrete Poynting theorem holds exactly for
 * theta = 1/2 and div B is preserved exactly. The paper was using a
 * third-order finite-element discretisation instead.
 *
 *  - Periodic boundaries only for now
 *  - ehall/egradpe/egradpedt2/dmoments/dmomentsdt2/bgb's non-volume
 *    components are accepted but NOT used.
 *  - Only bgb's *volume* components (BGBXVOL/BGBYVOL/BGBZVOL) are read, to combine
 *    with perb's volume components into a cell-centered total B for the tensor
 *    build.
